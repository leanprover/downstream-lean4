# Commitment Schemes: Syntax and Correctness

The syntax of a commitment scheme ([BonehShoup2023], Section 8.12): committing
to a message samples a commitment-opening pair `(c, o)`, verification of a
claimed opening is deterministic, and honestly generated pairs always verify.

The algorithms are plain functions, with no efficiency or finiteness
assumptions. Security notions live in separate definitions, so the same syntax
can carry perfect, statistical, or computational security.

## Main definitions

- `Scheme`: commitment syntax with perfect correctness
- `Scheme.commitmentDist`: the public commitment distribution for a message
- `Scheme.mem_support_commitmentDist_iff`: a commitment is possible exactly
  when it has a possible opening
- `Scheme.Accepts`: the verifier's acceptance relation

/-- A noninteractive, unkeyed commitment scheme over message, commitment, and
opening types ([BonehShoup2023], Section 8.12).

Committing is randomized and produces the commitment and opening together,
since the two may be correlated. Correctness requires that every
commitment-opening pair the honest committer can output is accepted by the
verifier; for a `PMF`, this says honest openings verify with probability
one. -/
