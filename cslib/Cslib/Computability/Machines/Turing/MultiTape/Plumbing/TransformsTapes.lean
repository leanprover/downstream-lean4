# Machines as transformers of tape words

The interface through which combinators use machines: a machine reads words from its work tapes
and leaves words on them. A combinator composing such machines talks about words only, never about
individual cells, head positions or the set of tapes a machine has touched.

Configurations are described by *equalities*: `wordsCfg input q ws out` is the configuration whose
work tape `i` holds exactly the word `ws i` (contents `tapeOfList (ws i)`, head at the start), with
the input head at the start of the input and output `out`. A specification
`TransformsTapes tm P Q t s` says: started on word-holding tapes satisfying `P`, after exactly `t`
steps the machine sits in the halted *normal form* `wordsCfg input none ws' (out ++ emitted)`
(every head reset to its initial position, tapes blank outside their words, the word `emitted`
appended to the output it was handed), with the new words related to the old ones by `Q` and using
at most `s` work-tape cells. The machine may halt earlier than `t`; since a halted machine stays
put and stops visiting new cells, running on to `t` costs nothing, so a fixed step count loses no
generality and spares every composition an existential.
Requiring this normal form is what lets specifications compose by rewriting: the halting
configuration of one machine is already a valid start for the next, so which words survived a step
is read off the equation, not re-established cell by cell.

The output is described as the word the machine *appends*, never as an absolute value, so that a
specification is insensitive to the output it is handed — which is what lets specifications
compose: along a sequence the emitted words concatenate.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.TransformsTapes`: the specification format described above.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.nop`: the machine that does nothing.

## Main results

* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.TransformsTapes.imp`: strengthen the precondition, weaken the postcondition
  and raise the bounds.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.transformsTapes_iff_nil_output`: the generality in the ambient output is
  free, so a concrete machine need only be run with no prior output.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.transformsTapes_nop`: `nop` leaves every word as it was, the first machine of
  the interface and the check that the format is inhabited as intended.

/-- `TransformsTapes tm P Q t s`: started in its initial state on tapes holding words `ws` that
satisfy the precondition `P`, the machine is halted after exactly `t` steps in the configuration
whose tapes hold words `ws'` and which has appended `emitted` to the output it was handed, with
`Q input ws ws' emitted`, having used at most `s` work-tape cells. The machine is free to halt
before step `t`, because it then stays in that configuration.

The bounds are numbers; a specification whose bounds depend on the data is a *family*

/-- **The ambient output is a concern of sequencing, not of machines.** A specification holds for
every prior output as soon as it holds for none, because a machine never reads what it has already
written. This is where that generality is discharged, once, rather than by every caller: a concrete
machine enters the interface by proving the right-hand side.

The only consumer of the generality is `Turing.MultiTapeTM.transformsTapes_seq`, which runs the
second machine after the first has emitted. -/
